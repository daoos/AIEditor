# AIEditor
AI Editor built on top of Blockly
The Editor has been forked from Blockly; Google's open source visual editor that breaks codebase into visual blocks and generates code.
Our attempt is to add NLP / conversational module to the initiative using which you can simply talk to the engine, and describe intent
in natural language. The editor should be able to generate code automatically.

The reason for choosing Blockly as the base is because the structure makes it easy to experiment and we will focus more on 
building the core functionality rather than nuances of an editor.
